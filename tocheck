Create a Observable on Favorite Items
Create a Observable on Shopping Cart
What if I have Favorite Items in shopping Cart?
Well that does not matter because it is different observable?
Ok but how to solve this problem?
It will require single source of truth.
Lets say that I have database
When the item is added to shopping cart it will update the database, and after or during update the request will be send to the shopping cart Observable
Ok but what about the button add-remove item from cart? It will be added only to the shopping cart Component, so at this point its not the biggest issue.
Do I need to know which item is added to shopping list inside the favorite component? Not really, Allegro does not have that, also amazon does not have that
Adding new item often just factor the number of items in the shopping cart so there is no need to view it at this point
if ill assume that I want to know this, i can get the data from db, instead of using favorite-items observable, and also update it

{user:id, rest of the items}
